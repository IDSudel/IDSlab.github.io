Introduction for IDS lab:Information Decision Science Laboratory(IDS) Complex systems are encountered in many applications including sustainable transportation, power grids, fusion and other alternative energy strategies, and biological systems. Addressing many of our most pressing challenges, related to the increasing demand for energy and transportation, requires the use of scalable data and informatics towards enhancing our understanding of complex systems. As we move to increasingly complex systems with an expanded feature space, new mathematical approaches are needed to understand the impact on system behavior of the interplay between subsystems of different physical processes, at different scales, or between decision points in an engineered system. Â  The overarching goal of the IDS Lab is to enhance understanding of complex systems and establish a holistic, multifaceted approach using scalable data and informatics to developing rigorous mathematical models and decentralized control algorithms for making complex systems able to realize how to improve their performance over time while interacting with their environment. The research hypothesis is that if we could develop mathematical models to characterize emergence, then we would be able to designate the rules for the interactions of the individual entities so that the desired emergent phenomena would occur. Furthermore, if such mathematical models were available, then we could develop the algorithms to predict the tipping points of complex systems. Enhancing our understanding of complex systems will have a major impact on various applications in Transportation and Energy.
